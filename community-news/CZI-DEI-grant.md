 title: "Advancing an inclusive culture in the scientific Python ecosystem"
 ---

We are happy to announce the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has awarded a grant
to support the onboarding, inclusion, and retention of people from
historically underrepresented groups on scientific Python projects, and to
structurally improve the community dynamics for NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,
and Pandas.

The grant supports the creation of dedicated Contributor Experience Lead positions 
to identify, document, and implement practices to foster inclusive open-source communities. 
By establishing these new cross-project roles, we hope to introduce a new
collaboration model to the Scientific Python communities, allowing
community-building work within the ecosystem to be done more efficiently
and with greater outcomes. We also expect to develop a clearer picture of
what works and what doesn’t in our projects to engage and retain new
contributors, especially from historically underrepresented groups.

The project is led by Melissa Mendonça (NumPy), with additional mentorship
and guidance provided by Ralf Gommers (NumPy, SciPy), Hannah Aizenman and
Thomas Caswell (Matplotlib), Matt Haberland (SciPy), and Joris Van den
Bossche (Pandas).
